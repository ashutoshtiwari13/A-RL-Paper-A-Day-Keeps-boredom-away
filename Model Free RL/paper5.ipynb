    "### Prioritizing with TD -error\n",
    "- The magnitude of transitions TD error $\\delta$ , which is an indicator of how'surprising' or unexpected a transition was, which can help measure the importance of each transition. NOte: TD error can be a poor estimate in some circumstances where rewards are noisy\n",
    "- The 'greedy TD-error prioritization' algorithm stores the last encountered TD error along with each transition in the replay memory and the transition with the largest absolute TD error is replayed from the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Prioritization\n",
    "- The above algorithm has issues of transitions that have low TD error on first visit nt being repalyed for a long time as to avoid expensive sweeps over the entire replay memory, the TD erros are only updated for the transitions that are replayed.\n",
    "- Secondly , the above algorithm is sensitive to noise spikes , which can be made worse by bootstrapping where apporaximation errors become another source of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To overcome these issues, a stochastic sampling method is introduced that interpolates between pure greedy prioritization and uniform random sampling\n",
    "- The first variant we consider is the direct, proportional prioritization where $\\mathcal{p}_i = |\\delta_i| + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive constant that prevents the edge-case of transitions not being revisited once their error is zero. The second variant is an indirect, rank-based prioritization where $\\mathcal{p}_{i}=1/\\mathcal{rank(i)}$, where rank(i) is the rank of transition i when the replay memory is sorted according to |Î´i|.\n",
    "- Both variants of stochastic prioritization lead to large speed-ups over the uniform baseline"
