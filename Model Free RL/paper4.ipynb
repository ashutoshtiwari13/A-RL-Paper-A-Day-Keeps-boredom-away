    "- Q-learning sometimes learn unrealistically high action values because it includes a maximization step over estimated action values, which tends to prefer overestimated to underestimated values. These can lead to insufficient function approximations and unwanted noise.\n",
    "- Though being optimistic about action values is a well-known exploration technique( Kaelbling et al., 1996) , being over optimistuc i.e when the action values are over estimated non-uniformaly and not concentrated at the states about which we want to learn, they might negatively effect the quality of the resulting policy ."
